GREETINGS FROM BLIZZARD

  Welcome to the Battle.net beta for Starcraft.  We hope that you are 
  as excited as we are to be putting Starcraft through its paces.  
  This beta is multi-player only and can only be played over 
  Battle.net.  The beta will give you a taste of the complete product; 
  however, it does not include many of the features of the full game, 
  including single-player campaigns, cinematic sequences, computer 
  opponents, and much more.

  The purpose of this beta is to test the many new features 
  implemented in Battle.net, balance the game, verify compatibility 
  with a multitude of systems, and -- most importantly -- find bugs.  
  We appreciate both bug reports and suggestions about play balance.  

HOW LONG WILL THE BETA LAST?

  We expect the beta to run from one to three weeks depending on how
  smoothly the testing process runs.

WILL THE BETA RUN UNTIL STARCRAFT SHIPS?

  The beta may run until the release of Starcraft, or it may be 
  stopped prior to release.  Again, this will be dependent on how 
  smoothly the beta test goes.

HOW TO SEND US YOUR FEEDBACK

  After installing Starcraft, you will find a "Report Bugs" icon in
  the Starcraft folder of your Start Menu.  This provides a quick 
  link to our web site, where you can report bugs.  Alternately, you 
  can access this web page directly at: 

  http://www.battle.net/beta/report.htm

  It is important that you report any and all bugs immediately, 
  and in a clear and complete manner. Describe, as best you can, 
  exactly what occured when the bug was found.  If you can recreate 
  the bug by following an exact set of steps, please do so and report 
  how to recreate the bug as well.

USING YOUR CD KEY

  When you install Starcraft, you will be asked to enter your CD Key.
  This CD Key number can be found at the bottom of the brightly 
  colored insert that came with your Starcraft CD.  DO NOT LOSE THIS 
  NUMBER. If you should need to re-install Starcraft, you will need 
  your CD Key.

  Your CD Key grants you access to Battle.net.  Only one user can be
  logged on at a time with each CD Key. Do not give your CD Key 
  out to anyone.  Blizzard employees will not ask you to reveal your 
  CD Key.

  Again, please note that your personal CD Key is found at the 
  bottom of the brightly colored insert that came with your 
  Starcraft Beta CD.

LOGGING ONTO BATTLE.NET

  After installing and starting Starcraft, select the "Multiplayer" 
  option from the main menu. Now, select the Battle.net connection 
  method.  Starcraft will automatically search for the fastest 
  connection to Battle.net.  If your version of Starcraft requires 
  patching, Battle.net will do this automatically when your 
  connection is completed.  During the course of the beta it is 
  likely that there will be multiple patches.

  The first thing you will need to do is to create a Battle.net 
  account so that we can activate your Unique User ID.  Click the 
  "New Account" button.  Type the name you wish to use on Battle.net 
  in the "Name" field.  Now enter the password you wish to use for 
  this ID in the "Password" field.  You will then need to type this
  password again in the "Repeat Password" field to confirm your choice.
  
  When you return to the Battle.net Login screen, you will see your 
  Battle.net ID in the "Name" field. To go onto Battle.net, enter 
  your password in the "Password" field and click "Ok".

  NOTE: Write down your password at this time and keep it in a 
  safe place.  We cannot look up or change your password, so if you 
  forget it, you will need to create a new Battle.net ID.  Do not 
  give out your password to other users.  Blizzard employees will not 
  ask you to reveal your password.
